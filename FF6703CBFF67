There would have been another riddle here involving you
sorting a big vector of numbers from least to greatest,
taking the least 4 numbers, converting them to ascii to find out
that I like CATS, but instead I just got you a calendar with kittens on it.

Close enough.

Something about a wikipedia scavenger hunt too using CATS to find out that
I like comic superheroes and all the latest superhero movies. I'll just tell you that here.


Some scheduling:
Saturday after reveal, I was hoping we could go watch Guardians of the Galexy being shown by VTU for free.
After that, we could grab some food and finally go drink and hang out at a friend's place. Sound good?


And one more hint, in case you're still stuck on the first riddle.
Try counting the number of characters in the first line, not including spaces. 
Compare to the numbering of lines 1 and 2 and
perhaps you will notice something. Then perhaps those numbers at the bottom will make sense. ;)
